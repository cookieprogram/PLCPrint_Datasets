I've added some datasets for 2 different PLC models (Siemens and AB (Allen-Bradley)). There are some baseline files which contain normal behaviour and then files with attacks for the 2 different attack types (static and dynamic). The datasets that contain no timestamps were used for detection.

I've also included a PCAP file of some Siemens S7Comm traffic which is the application protocol that Siemens PLCs use to represent data in network communications. I can provide additional PCAPs, and happy to discuss more next week.
